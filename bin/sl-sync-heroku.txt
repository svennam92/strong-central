Options:
  -h,--help         Print this message and exit.
  -v,--version      Print version and exit.
  -b,--base BASE    Base directory to work in (default `.strong-central`).
  -c,--check	    Check if Central DB is consistent with Heroku.
  -d,--dry-run 		Non destructive version of update.
  -u,--update 		Update Central DB to be consistent with Heroku.

Compare models stored on Central DB against Heroku app data.  Update
Central DB if inconsistent.

There are seceral cases that can make Central DB inconsistent with
the Herou app data:

- Resource provisioned to Heroku, but errors occur when creating
  Central models
- Heroku command is rejected because Heroku has put all dynos to sleep
  (destroys)
- In case multiple instances are registered for a service but some
  are referring to stale Heroku dynos, Central should record those
  instances as stopped.
