usage: %MAIN% [options]

The Strongloop Central.

Options:
  -h,--help         Print this message and exit.
  -v,--version      Print version and exit.
  -b,--base BASE    Base directory to work in (default `.strong-central`).
  -l,--listen PORT  Listen on PORT for git pushes (default 8701).

The base directory is used to save deployed applications, for working
directories, and for any other files that need to be created.

Strongloop Central will be controllable via HTTP on the port specified. That
port is also used for deployment with strong-deploy. Basic authentication
can be enabled for HTTP by setting the STRONGLOOP_PM_HTTP_AUTH environment
variable to <user>:<pass> (eg. strong-central:super-secret).

It is also controllable using local domain sockets, which look like file paths,
and the listen path can be changed or disabled. These sockets do not support
HTTP authentication.
